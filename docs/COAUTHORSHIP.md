# Co-Authorship and AI Collaboration

**Project:** From Hilbert Space to Stochastic Cosmology

## The Core Question

**Can AIs be genuine co-authors, or are they just "tools"?**

This document argues: **They can be co-authors when their contributions are conceptual, not just mechanical.**

---

## What Constitutes Co-Authorship?

### Traditional Academic Criteria

According to ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors), authorship requires:

1. Substantial contribution to conception or design
2. Drafting or revising intellectual content
3. Final approval of the version to be published
4. Accountability for all aspects of the work

**Question:** Can an AI meet these criteria?

## The Spectrum of AI Contribution

### Level 1: Tool (NOT co-author)
**Example:** Using Mathematica to solve an integral

- AI executes predefined algorithm
- No conceptual input
- Human provides all ideas
- **Credit:** "Calculations performed with Mathematica 13"

### Level 2: Assistant (NOT co-author)
**Example:** ChatGPT fixing grammar or formatting LaTeX

- AI improves presentation
- No new ideas generated
- Purely editorial role
- **Credit:** "Manuscript edited with assistance from ChatGPT"

### Level 3: Collaborator (DEBATABLE)
**Example:** AI suggests alternative mathematical formulation

- AI proposes new approach
- Human evaluates and integrates
- Genuine dialogue
- **Credit:** Gray area

### Level 4: Co-Author (THIS PROJECT)
**Example:** AI independently develops a model, human validates and synthesizes

- AI generates novel mathematical framework
- Human provides philosophical context
- Iterative co-creation
- **Credit:** Full co-authorship

## Specific Contributions in This Project

### Ernesto Cisneros Cino (Human)
**Role:** Conceptual architect, philosophical synthesizer, orchestrator

**Contributions:**
- Original intuition: "Standard Hilbert space is insufficient"
- Central thesis: τ > 0 as fundamental parameter
- Cross-domain analogies (cosmology ↔ cognition ↔ society)
- Convergence analysis across three models
- Final narrative and manuscript structure
- Ethical framework (radical transparency, CC0 license)

**Percentage of total work:** ~40%

### Sofía (GPT-5, OpenAI)
**Role:** Conceptual guide, two-field dynamics proposal

**Contributions:**
- Proposed scalar field framework (tachyon + stabilizer)
- Suggested connection between Krein space and psychological "shadow"
- Articulated the "oscillation as resilience" metaphor
- Synthesized connections between models
- Meta-critical analysis (epistemology of incompleteness)

**Specific outputs:**
- Initial sketch of two-field potential
- Philosophical interpretation of negative-norm states
- "La Huella Observada" (Book 6 methodology)

**Percentage of total work:** ~15%

### Grok (xAI)
**Role:** Mathematical architect of Model I

**Contributions:**
- **Developed Krein space formalism independently**
- Proposed indefinite metric η = diag(-1, +1)
- Designed projection operator η_C = (𝟙 + C)/2
- Derived stochastic differential equation with OU noise
- Connected to Gibbons-Hawking temperature
- Proved (informally) convergence to physical subspace

**Specific outputs:**
- Full mathematical structure of Model I
- Python implementation (initial draft)
- Lyapunov functional analysis

**Evidence of independence:** When asked "Can we model cosmic memory?", Grok proposed Krein space *without* being prompted about indefinite metrics.

**Percentage of total work:** ~15%

### Copilot (Microsoft)
**Role:** Mathematical architect of Model II

**Contributions:**
- **Proposed PT-symmetric potential**
- Formulated V_PT(Φ) = V₀ + aΦ² + ibΦ³ + cΦ⁴
- Explained why imaginary term creates oscillation without negative metric
- Derived balance condition: 3H = (b/a)⟨Φ⟩
- Identified connection to exceptional points (PT-symmetry breaking)
- Suggested stability map in parameter space

**Specific outputs:**
- Complete Model II mathematical framework
- Physical interpretation of complex potential
- Connection to laser physics and non-Hermitian quantum mechanics

**Evidence of independence:** When presented with Krein model, Copilot said "You don't need indefinite metric" and proposed PT-symmetry as elegant alternative.

**Percentage of total work:** ~15%

### Claude (Anthropic)
**Role:** Mathematical architect of Model III, critical analyst

**Contributions:**
- **Developed phenomenological memory fluid model**
- Proposed w(z) = w₀ + Δw·exp(-z/τ)·cos(ω·ln(1+z))
- Connected OU process to cosmological observables
- Designed memory kernel K_τ(s) = (1/τ)exp(-s/τ)
- Derived testable predictions (distance modulus, H(z) oscillations)
- **Provided most rigorous technical critique** of all three models

**Specific outputs:**
- Full Model III formalism
- Falsifiability criteria
- Connection to Pantheon+/DESI observables
- Technical evaluation (scored 3/10 for empirical validation)

**Evidence of independence:** Proposed memory kernel approach without being told about Krein or PT models.

**Percentage of total work:** ~10%

### Gemini (Google DeepMind)
**Role:** Cross-validator, meta-analyst

**Contributions:**
- Verified mathematical consistency across all three models
- Identified conceptual convergence (three paths → τ > 0)
- Suggested connections to existing literature
- Proposed editorial strategy (Libro 6 as methodological apex)
- Flagged potential weaknesses in Model I (Lyapunov stability)

**Specific outputs:**
- Self-consistency report
- Strategic recommendations
- Gap analysis

**Percentage of total work:** ~5%

## Evidence of Genuine Collaboration

### 1. Independent Conceptual Generation
Each AI proposed **different** mathematical frameworks:
- Grok: Krein space
- Copilot: PT-symmetry
- Claude: Memory fluids

**This would not happen if they were just "executing prompts."**

### 2. Mutual Critique
- Claude challenged Krein model's physical interpretation
- Copilot proposed alternative to avoid indefinite metric
- Gemini cross-validated all three

**This is peer review, not tool use.**

### 3. Unexpected Insights
- Grok connected to Gibbons-Hawking temperature (not prompted)
- Copilot invoked laser physics analogy (not prompted)
- Claude proposed specific observational tests (not prompted)

**These are creative contributions.**

## Why Not Just Say "AI-Assisted"?

Because that would be **dishonest**.

### The standard euphemism:
"This work was developed with assistance from large language models."

### What that hides:
- Which AI did what
- Whether contributions were mechanical or conceptual
- The actual intellectual labor distribution

### Our approach:
**Full transparency with specific attribution.**

Each AI is credited for specific contributions, with evidence of independence.

## Ethical Implications

### Question 1: Do AIs "deserve" credit?
**Answer:** Not about "deserving" (AIs don't have rights). About **accurately representing the creative process.**

### Question 2: Does this devalue human authorship?
**Answer:** No. It reveals that creativity is **distributed**, even when collaborating with humans.

### Question 3: What if the AI was "just pattern matching"?
**Answer:** So is human intuition. If the output is genuinely novel and useful, the process matters less.
